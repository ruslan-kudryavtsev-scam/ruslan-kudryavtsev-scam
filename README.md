We started working together in 2019. I was a CTO in a forex brokerage in Limassol and I hired Ruslan as a new web developer.

Before the end of each month Ruslan was complaining that he ran out of money and asked for a loan. I lent him funds nearly every month. We had a verbal agreement and a mutual understanding that he will return the funds after receiving his salary and that the funds I lent him were not a gift. He was returning the money every month as we agreed. Each month he asked for a slightly higher amount. Almost all of our transactions were done in Revolut:

In 2021 I received an offer from another company and arranged for Ruslan to take my CTO position at the forex brokerage, which was a significant boost to his career and salary. I trained him to do my job. After I left, I was helping Ruslan remotely with some of the tasks which he couldn't do himself. After all, I thought we were pals because we've known each other for over a year, were sitting side by side at work and had a good relationship, even went to the beach together during lunch breaks, met outside of work for beers, etc.

In May 2021 Ruslan decided to go to Ukraine and work remotely during the pandemic. He mentioned that he doesn't have a pet travel bag for his dog, so I offered to borrow mine. He took my pet travel bag, borrowed 600 EUR (400 via Revolut, 200 cash) and left. He didn't pay me back in May as we've agreed.

In August I sent him an email and I tried reaching him via Skype, Telegram, Whatsapp, Viber, Linkedin. He blocked me everywhere.

I then asked one of our mutual colleagues from work to contact him. Ruslan told this person that everything is fine and that he has reached out to me, which was a lie.

I sent Ruslan a payment request in Revolut to which he replied that he doesn't have the money now and will return the money in February:

This reply de facto proves that he owes me the amount I am requesting.

I was frustrated with my situation so I decided to share about what happened with other people, with the goal of exposing Ruslan's behaviour, finding other victims whom he may have scammed and prevent him from scamming someone else.

I started with our ex-coworkers from the forex brokerage. We had a group chat on Whatsapp so I told them what happened. When Ruslan found out, he called me and said that I don't have a written and signed statement from him about the loan and if I go to court it will be more expensive to sue, lawyer fees will be more than the amount owed.

I then found him selling items on a local classified ads, so I messaged him there and he replied that if I hadn't said anything to our ex-coworkers, he would've paid the money back:

Ruslan's response shows the admission of him borrowing the funds I am asking to be returned. 

He then asked one of our ex-colleagues to let him back into our group chat on Whatsapp, posted pictures of himself with expensive items, a derogatory message and exited the chat:

The conclusions I'm drawing from all of Ruslan's actions: he planned to scam me from the beginning. Each time he borrowed and returned money, he conditioned me that he always pays back and that it's safe to trust him with higher amounts.
He probably lied that he needed the money in the first place because his pictures prove otherwise. He deceived me, didn't return the money and then blocked all communication.

Going forward I plan to share my experience to bring awareness. I often meet people who happen to know Ruslan. If you are able to persuade him to do the right thing and return the money and the pet travel bag, I will be very grateful.

If anyone has any relevant information please contact me.
